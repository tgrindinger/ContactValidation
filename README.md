# ContactValidation
I've only used JSON.net for json parsing in the past, so I had to refer to Microsoft's documentation to get System.Text.Json working here, but it was pretty simple.

Objective is to perform some validation on a list of contacts and report a list of cities with the number of validation errors in each.

This is supposed to be a simple script, so I didn't go through too many pains to follow best practices, but if it were to be integrated into a feature for a larger product, I'd do quite a bit of refactoring.
